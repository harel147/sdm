# SDM and SSDM

Supervised Diffusion Maps (SDM) and Semi-Supervised Diffusion Maps (SSDM), transform the well-known unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithm, Diffusion Maps, into supervised and semi-supervised learning tools.

More details can be found in our paper [TODO](https://arxiv.org/******)

## Installing
You can install all the required packages by executing the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements_python_3_08.txt
```

## How to use SDM and SSDM
Check out the examples for using SDM with regression and classification datasets in `supervised_regression_example.py` and
`supervised_classification_example.py` for the supervised setting, and SSDM in `semi_supervised_regression_example.py` and
`semi_supervised_classification_example.py` for the semi-supervised setting.

We also provide an optimized version of SSDM for the semi-supervised setting, suitable for large datasets. In this version, we sample only 1%â€“10% of the labels and leverage `torch` for GPU acceleration. Examples of how to use the optimized SSDM can be found in `optimized_ssdm_classification_mnist.py` and `optimized_ssdm_classification_isolet.py`.

In general, our API is similar to the well-known sklearn transformers API. For SDM (supervised setting):

```python
train_data, test_data, train_labels, test_labels = ...
selected_t = 0.03  # in (0, 1)
n_components = 2
labels_type = 'regression'  # or 'classification'
model = SDM(n_components=n_components, labels_type=labels_type, setting='supervised')
sdm_train_embeddings = model.fit_transform(train_data, train_labels, t=selected_t)
sdm_test_embeddings = model.transform(test_data, t=selected_t)
```

For SSDM (semi-supervised setting):

```python
train_data, test_data, train_labels, test_labels = ...
selected_t = 0.93  # in (0, 1)
n_components = 2
labels_type = 'regression'  # or 'classification'
model = SDM(n_components=n_components, labels_type=labels_type, setting='semi-supervised')
ssdm_train_embeddings, ssdm_test_embeddings = model.fit_transform(train_data, train_labels, test_data, t=selected_t)
```

For optimized SSDM (semi-supervised setting):

```python
train_data, test_data, train_labels, test_labels = ...
selected_t = -1  # in (0, 1), or -1 for not using t.
n_components = 2
labels_type = 'classification'  # optimized SSDM currently supports only classification
data_eps = 100
sample_ratio = 0.01
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
model = optimized_SSDM(n_components=n_components, labels_type='classification', data_eps=data_eps, sample_ratio=sample_ratio, device=device)
ssdm_train_embeddings, ssdm_test_embeddings = model.fit_transform(train_data, train_labels, test_data, t=selected_t)
```
